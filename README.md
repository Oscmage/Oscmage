### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer primarily breaking things in backend systems but I also dabble with infastructure, data engineering and frontend (I guess what I'm saying is that I work fullstack?). Currently working as a Senior Backend Engineer at Ark Kapital. Ex-Spotify where I worked primarily with Subscriptions and payments.
